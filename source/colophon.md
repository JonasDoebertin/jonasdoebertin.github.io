This website serves as my digital home base – the one place on the internet where everything I do, build, and share comes together. Whether you're here to check out my coding projects, explore my [Formiilo designs on Printables](https://www.printables.com/@Formiilo), or just browsing out of curiosity: *welcome*.

The site is built with Jigsaw, a static site generator by the team at Tighten. I chose Jigsaw because it strikes a great balance between structure and flexibility, especially for someone who enjoys clean, maintainable code. The visual styling is powered by Tailwind CSS, which lets me design directly in the markup using utility classes – a workflow I’ve grown to love for its speed and consistency.

Under the hood, a Vite-based build pipeline takes care of bundling and transforming assets. It keeps things fast and modern, with support for hot module reloading and lightning-quick rebuilds – even during development.

Deployment is handled via GitHub Pages, which keeps everything simple, version-controlled, and close to the source. The entire process – from development to production – is automated through a GitHub Actions workflow, so publishing changes is as easy as pushing to the main branch.

If you're curious about how it all fits together, you're more than welcome to explore [the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/JonasDoebertin/jonasdoebertin.github.io). It includes the full project setup, the build configuration, and the deployment pipeline.
