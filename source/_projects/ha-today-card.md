During overhauling my personal wall tablet dashboard, I wanted to change the display of todays event schedule a little bit, to make it a bit sleeker.

So *Today Card* was brought to life. It shows—who would have guessed—today's calendar schedule on your Home Assistant Lovelace Dashboard. With a visual card editor and many customerization options, it's dead simple to use.
