A long time ago, I created a component for Delphi called UbuntuProgress. Now, nearly 6 years later, I still get one or two emails a month asking about where to get it.

## Backstory

I created this component in summer 2008, actually I was still attending school and had a lot of spare time. I was toying around with various linux distributions when I noticed this nice little progress bar that Ubuntu had at that time. I immediately liked the look and feel and decided to recreate it for one of my school projects. It turned out to be a great experience and helped a lot with learning Pascal and Delphi.

After I finished the first version and it was stable enough, I presented it to a German Delphi community called [Delphi-Praxis](http://www.delphipraxis.net/115652-tubuntuprogress-progressbar-im-ubuntu-stil-*version-1-2*.html). After some initial feedback I worked on it sporadically for a few months, but soon turned to more important things.

## Today

As of today, I'm still receiving one or two emails a month of people asking where to download the component and the demo program I created. As the websites I had at that time doesn't exist any longer, I decided to move the code over to [GitHub](https://github.com/JonasDoebertin/UbuntuProgress) where you can clone, fork, or do whatever you want with it.

Additionally, I was able to recover the demo program just recently. You can download and play around with it [here](http://s3.jd-powered.net/downloads/delphi/TUbuntuProgress1.2.zip).

**Please keep in mind** that neither the code itself nor the demo program have been touched since late 2008. There are no updates, bugfixes and more importantly no support available from my side. If you however want to fork the code and make it your own project, please go ahead!
