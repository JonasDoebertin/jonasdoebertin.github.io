<p class="lead">
    A while ago, I built a Delphi component called UbuntuProgress. Nearly <s>six</s> <em>even more</em> years later, I’m still getting the occasional email—usually every other month—asking where to find it.

## Backstory

I originally created the component in the summer of 2008. At the time, I was still in school and had plenty of spare time. While experimenting with various Linux distributions, I came across a small but visually appealing progress bar in Ubuntu. I immediately liked its clean look and decided to recreate it for one of my school projects.

It turned out to be a fun and valuable learning experience, especially when it came to getting more comfortable with Pascal and Delphi.

Once I had a stable first version, I shared it with the German Delphi community [Delphi-Praxis](http://www.delphipraxis.net/115652-tubuntuprogress-progressbar-im-ubuntu-stil-*version-1-2*.html). I received some helpful feedback and continued tweaking the component on and off for a few months. Eventually, though, other things took priority.

## Today

Fast forward to today, I still get occasional emails asking where to download the component and the demo project. Since the websites I originally hosted it on no longer exist, I’ve decided to move everything over to GitHub. Feel free to clone it, fork it, or use it however you like.

Just a heads-up: the component has not been updated since late 2008. There are no bug fixes, no new features, and no support from my side. That said, if you want to fork the project and continue developing it—go for it!
